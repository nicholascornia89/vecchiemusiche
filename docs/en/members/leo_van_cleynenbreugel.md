Leo Van Cleynenbreugel grew up surrounded by classical music. His father is a choir conductor and his mother taught him the violin. As a boy he sang at the Brussels Opera. After finishing secondary school he went to Ghent University to study Indology (Hindi, Sanskrit). During his studies he spent a year in India where he learned traditional theatre and did volunteer work. Then he started his drama training at the School of Arts (Ghent), where he first experienced Fitzmaurice Voicework™, with Peter Rouffaer as a teacher. Now, he is a certified teacher, organizes workshops, and keeps training himself in voice and movement.
