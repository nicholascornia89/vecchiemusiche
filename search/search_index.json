Or is history a river, where the names are written on fragile parchment, floating around in small bowls? Noble swans swim round, select names and take them to a temple built on a small island. In analogy to the swans, we also save the names we consider important from oblivion and in so doing construct our cultural history and identity.<sup>1</sup></p> <ul> <li> <p>MISSION</p> <p>To give a new voice to those forgotten by history, is the mission of the ensemble Le Vecchie Musiche, e la nuova maniera di leggerle. It proposes a new way of reading our cultural heritage, too often dominated by a rigid aesthetic canon.</p> </li> <li> <p>NAME</p> <p>The name of the ensemble is a parody (a paraphrase in musical terms) of the famous collection of Giulio Caccini: Le Nuove Musiche, published in 1602. The monodies of Caccini contributed to the establishment of solo singing with instrumental accompaniment, thanks to the rapid spreading of music print editions. In an analogous way the development of digital technologies of the last decades has given us the possibility to share, research and find original sources worldwide.</p> </li> <li> <p>PROJECTS</p> <p>The projects within Le Vecchie Musiche are the result of the study of the life and works of musicians, supported by recent musicological research.</p> <p>These discoveries are presented to the listener through the life and music of artists from the past, opening up possibilities for interpretation and connection with our contemporary society.</p> </li> <li> <p>HISTORY &amp; FUTURE</p> <p>The first experiment of the ensemble took place during October 2018, with the performance of the oratorium Santa Editta by composer Alessandro Stradella (1639-1682). The project, conceived by the artistic director Nicholas Cornia, resulted in the cooperation of a collective of students at the Ghent Conservatory. Since then every other project has been unique and collectively built. Through the intermingling of story and music of forgotten artists, the public takes a peek into the social and cultural context of past times and lives. Le Vecchie musiche aims to valorise artists excluded by our aesthetic canon. Through original concert programs, workshops, music transcriptions and research articles it offers new insights to our conception of the past.</p> </li> </ul> <ol> <li> <p>Reference to the voyage of Astolfo to the moon in Ariosto\u2019s Orlando Furioso, Canto XXXV.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"en/projects/","title":"Projects","text":""},{"location":"en/projects/#oddities-rarities-2024","title":"Oddities &amp; Rarities (2024)","text":"<p> Western Europe experienced a trend of Orientalist and Exotic art in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which generated a large cultural, and especially musical, body of work. However, today this repertoire is bathed in questionable waters, with which Imperialism, Colonialism and cultural appropriation are associated. The project wishes to propose a way to deal with this as musicians and as audiences.

The rising wealth of the British middle class created a vast market for leisure, such as theater plays, novels and most of all music entertainment. Many Italians of the time, such as the composers Giovanni Bononcini, Nicola Porpora and Attilio Ariosti, were seeking fortune and fame in the sparkling Northern European metropolis, a fate still shared nowadays by many expats of the Bel Paese.

The name itself presents a paradox: how can a madrigal, that is a representation in music of secular poetry in polyphonic style, bear traits of an aria, associated with solistic singing? In our concert program Madrigali Ariosi we recount the love affairs of the many characters in the Orlando Furioso, through various compositions of this particular musical genre.

In their texts, which can be considered proto-feminist, the Macist view, which considers women inferior to men, is abandoned in favor of a model in which the two sexes complement each other, achieving eutrapelia, that is, the balance of opposites described in the utopian worlds of Thomas Campanella\u2019s The City of the Sun and Margaret Cavendish\u2019s The Blazing World.</p> <p>We have chosen not to make public the names of the composers who set these \u201csprezzanti\u201d verses to music. The reason for this choice is twofold: the first is to enhance the poet\u2019s contribution to the madrigal genre, confirming that it is nothing more than an aural representation of the collective declamation of a text. The second reason, much more insidious for the listener, is that one of the madrigals is a forgery composed especially for this concert. Will you be able to recognize it and appreciate its artistic value regardless of its \u201cauthenticity\u201d?</p>"},{"location":"en/projects/sprezzanti_rime/#performers","title":"Performers","text":"<ul> <li>Nicholas Cornia (artistic director, bass) </li> <li>Maria Eichler (alto)</li> <li>Andrea Gavagnin (contratenor) </li> <li>Thomas Langlois (lute)</li> <li>Leander Van Gijsegem (tenor)</li> <li>Lidwien Van Winckel (soprano) </li> </ul>"},{"location":"en/projects/sprezzanti_rime/#media","title":"Media","text":""},{"location":"it/","title":"Index","text":"<ul> <li>Progetti </li> <li>Archivio Digitale </li> </ul>"},{"location":"nl/","title":"Index","text":"<ul> <li>Projecten </li> <li>Digitaal Archief </li> </ul>"}]}
