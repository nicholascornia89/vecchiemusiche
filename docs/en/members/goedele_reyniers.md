Goedele Reyniers studied Art History and Archaeology at the UGent, followed by the study of conservation/restoration of artworks at the KASK in Ghent. She works as a restorer of mural paintings. She started taking singing classes at the academy APK in Ghent only at the age of 29, being pregnant with her eldest son, in order to be able to sing lullabies without a cracked voice. It turned out that classical singing is not very suitable for lullabies.

However she seemed to have a good alto for early music and polyphony, and she joined the Ghent chamber choir El Grillo in 2007, of which she is a member ever since.
She occasionally sings with other ensembles for one-off projects, the most important being the production of Rossiniâ€™s Willem Tell at De Munt.

Singing sad songs and arias at funerals also led her to her new part-time profession as a funeral director.
