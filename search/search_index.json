Or is history a river, where the names are written on fragile parchment, floating around in small bowls? Noble swans swim round, select names and take them to a temple built on a small island. In analogy to the swans, we also save the names we consider important from oblivion and in so doing construct our cultural history and identity.<sup>1</sup></p> <ul> <li> <p>MISSION</p> <p>To give a new voice to those forgotten by history, is the mission of the ensemble Le Vecchie Musiche, e la nuova maniera di leggerle. It proposes a new way of reading our cultural heritage, too often dominated by a rigid aesthetic canon.</p> </li> <li> <p>NAME</p> <p>The name of the ensemble is a parody (a paraphrase in musical terms) of the famous collection of Giulio Caccini: Le Nuove Musiche, published in 1602. The monodies of Caccini contributed to the establishment of solo singing with instrumental accompaniment, thanks to the rapid spreading of music print editions. In an analogous way the development of digital technologies of the last decades has given us the possibility to share, research and find original sources worldwide.</p> </li> <li> <p>PROJECTS</p> <p>The projects within Le Vecchie Musiche are the result of the study of the life and works of musicians, supported by recent musicological research.</p> <p>These discoveries are presented to the listener through the life and music of artists from the past, opening up possibilities for interpretation and connection with our contemporary society.</p> </li> <li> <p>HISTORY &amp; FUTURE</p> <p>The first experiment of the ensemble took place during October 2018, with the performance of the oratorium Santa Editta by composer Alessandro Stradella (1639-1682). The project, conceived by the artistic director Nicholas Cornia, resulted in the cooperation of a collective of students at the Ghent Conservatory. Since then every other project has been unique and collectively built. Through the intermingling of story and music of forgotten artists, the public takes a peek into the social and cultural context of past times and lives. Le Vecchie musiche aims to valorise artists excluded by our aesthetic canon. Through original concert programs, workshops, music transcriptions and research articles it offers new insights to our conception of the past.</p> </li> </ul> <ol> <li> <p>Reference to the voyage of Astolfo to the moon in Ariosto\u2019s Orlando Furioso, Canto XXXV.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"members/","title":"Members","text":""},{"location":"members/#members","title":"Members","text":""},{"location":"members/#artistic-director","title":"Artistic director","text":"<p>Nicholas Cornia</p> <p>Use the search bar to access musician's bios.</p>"},{"location":"project_template/","title":"Title","text":""},{"location":"project_template/#title","title":"Title","text":""},{"location":"project_template/#performers","title":"Performers","text":""},{"location":"project_template/#-nicholas-cornia-artistic-director-bass","title":"- Nicholas Cornia (artistic director, bass)","text":""},{"location":"project_template/#media","title":"Media","text":""},{"location":"projects/","title":"Projects","text":""},{"location":"projects/#projects","title":"Projects","text":""},{"location":"projects/#oddities-rarities-2025","title":"Oddities &amp; Rarities 2025","text":"<p> Oddities &amp; Rarities breaks down the boundaries between art forms, historical periods, reality and fiction.

Her first piano competition took place in 2001 (International Chopin competition), and in 2002 she won the second place at the international Bach competition in Narva. After moving to Belgium at age 10, she continued her musical studies in Belgium with Heidi Hendrickx at Ma\u2019GO in Antwerp. In 2008, she was admitted to the young talent class of the Royal Conservatory of Antwerp, where she studied with Levente Kende. She obtained her bachelors degree in 2014 at the Royal Conservatory of Ghent in the class of Vitaly Samoshko and her masters degree at the LUCA School of Arts Leuven with Timur Sergeyenia. At the moment, she studies harpsichord with Bart Naessens and fortepiano with Claire Chevalier at the conservatories of Brussels. </p> <p>Veera has several lied projects with vocalists, is active as continuo player in early music ensembles and teaches piano and harpsichord at the music academy of Jette.

Dagelijks ontdekken leerlingen, cursisten en liefhebbers de kracht van de literatuur van de oudheid. We kijken met bewondering naar de kunst binnen deze teksten, zowel in inhoud als in samenstelling, en we vertellen op onze beurt opnieuw hun verhalen verder. Deze verwondering was niet anders bij de Italianen van de 16e eeuw. Hoewel het Latijn voor hen nooit veraf was geweest, toch trad er binnen de Renaissance een nieuwe belangstelling op voor het materiaal waarmee ze al eeuwenlang de enkel Latijnse grammatica bestudeerden. Latijn was voor hen een gebruikstaal maar tegelijk ook de moeder van hun eigen Italiaans, net zoals hun geschiedenis van Rome en omstreken vervlochten was met de vele overblijfselen van die afgebrokkelde samenleving. </p> <p>Vanuit de architectuur en beeldhouwkunst vonden ze concrete voorbeelden om onderzoek naar te doen en te incorporeren in hun eigen stijl. Binnen de literatuur bestudeerden ze nu ook de inhoud en de opbouw van hun grammaticale leermeesters. Dichters als Francesco Petrarca en Pierre de Ronsard kwamen op voor hun eigen moedertaal, weg van het Latijn, maar konden het niet laten om hun eigen po\u00ebzie te doorspekken met verwijzingen naar Ovidius en Horatius. De humanisten zochten naar hun plaats in relatie tot de oudheid en diens erfenis. </p> <p>Deze evolutie was niet anders voor de muziek. Toch hadden de andere kunsten een voordeel binnen deze heropleving: zij hadden fysieke voorbeelden. Tempels, beelden en gekopieerde manuscripten konden onderzocht worden, de oude muziek van weleer bleef echter stil en verborgen. Dit hield de humanisten van de renaissance niet tegen om zelf een gooi te doen naar de heropleving van de oudheid in de muziek. </p> <p>Le Vecchie Musiche, een artistieke organisatie met een hart voor de onontgonnen parels van de muziekgeschiedenis, willen u nu graag in Discanting the Classics meenemen naar de 16e eeuw en hun relatie tot de klassieken. Wij bieden u een avondvullend concert aan van herontdekte muziek, omkaderd door bindteksten die ook dit historisch verhaal vertellen.

Het moment waarop de antichi (de ouden) het stokje doorgaven aan de moderni (de modernen) heeft veel weg van een faseovergang in de thermodynamica: op het moment dat de kritieke temperatuur bereikt is, veranderen plots alle watermolecules van vloeistof in gas, alsof ze gedirigeerd worden door een onzichtbare orkestdirigent.</p> <p>Op gelijkaardige manier is ons verteld dat de overgang tussen het muzikale tijdperk van de renaissance in dat van de barok het werk was van grote componisten als Claudio Monteverdi en theoretici als Vincenzo Galilei, waarbij het hele gamma tussen de zogenoemde polyfone en monodische stijl genegeerd wordt.</p> <p>E\u00e9n van de missing links in de stijlevolutie van de 16de eeuw is het zogenoemde arioso madrigaal. De naam zelf bevat een paradox: hoe kan een madrigaal, zijnde een muzikale voorstelling van profane po\u00ebzie in polyfone stijl, de kenmerken bezitten van een aria, immer geassocieerd met solozang? Het begrip aria is veel ouder dan we meestal denken. Het duidde melodische en harmonische patronen aan, die door minstrelen, vertellers en virtuozen gebruikt werden om ge\u00efmproviseerde gedichten of de literaire canon van muziek te voorzien.</p> <p>De arioso madrigalen maakten een brug tussen die volkse muziektraditie in Itali\u00eb en de polyfonie die de oltremontani er introduceerden, en legden op die manier de basis voor de artistieke hervorming van de barok.</p> <p>Recente studies tonen aan hoe de traditie van de ottava rima gebruikt werd in dat nieuwe madrigaalrepertoire. De onbetwiste ster in dat genre is de Orlando Furioso van Ludovico Ariosto, die met zijn verzen componisten inspireerde tot wel 666 madrigalen in de eeuw die volgde op de tweede en herwerkte uitgave van het boek in 1532.</p> <p>De verhalen over reizen, exotische plaatsen en liefdes tussen ridders en jonkvrouwen kunnen beschouwd worden als de pijlers van de moderne literatuur, waarin de legendes van de middeleeuwse literatuur zich vermengen met de waarden van een nieuwe wereld vol grote veranderingen en ontdekkingen.

Several records of complaints about Italian extravagant manners and lack of sincerity testify this trend. </p> <p>This cultural confrontation was mitigated by the common tropes of Greek and Roman mythology and literature, such as the Arcadian pantheon of shepherds, nymphs, satyrs and gods. </p> <p>Britons and Italians alike were fascinated and fully immersed in a pastoral craze where tales of love, nature and simplicity in an idyllic land laid the foundation of a shared fantasy.

Dankzij een bloeiende economie, groeiende industrie, nieuwe inkomsten uit kolonies en een oppermachtige marine groeide Engeland uit tot een welvarende mogendheid binnen Europa en de rest van de wereld. De nieuwe Britse middenklasse profiteerde en kon zich nieuwe vormen van ontspanning permitteren, waarop een bruisende entertainmentsector ontstond met theater, literatuur en muziek.  </p> <p>Veel Italiaanse kunstenaars uit die periode, onder wie componisten Giovanni Bononcini, Nicola Porpora en Attilio Ariosto, zochten roem en fortuin in de bruisende Noord-Europese metropool. Ook virtuoso instrumentalisten en zangers, zoals zangeres Margherita de l\u2019\u00c9pine (afgebeeld op het schilderij Rehearsal of an opera van Marco Ricci, vooraan dit boekje), plaatsten zich in het centrum van het Londense seizoen vol evenementen en geroddel.</p> <p>Buitenlandse kunstenaars domineerden de Londense scene en brachten eigen kunst en cultuur mee, die regelmatig indruisten tegen de Britse ideologie en esthetiek. Een blik op de resem gearchiveerde klachten over Italiaanse extravagantie en gebrek aan oprechtheid spreekt boekdelen.</p> <p>Een balsem voor die culturele clash, was de gedeelde liefde van buitenlanders en Engelsen voor de Griekse en Romeinse mythologie en literatuur, met een duidelijke voorkeur voor het Arcadische pantheon van herders, nimfen, saters en goden. Pastorale verhalen over liefde, natuur en eenvoud in een idyllisch land, die zowel terug te vinden waren bij de antieke schrijvers als in Schotse en andere lokale volksvertellingen vielen bij iedereen in goede aarde. De hunkering naar eenvoud en natuur zou in de romantische beweging volledig tot wasdom komen, in reactie op de groeiende invloed van industrie en wetenschap in de eeuw van de verlichting.</p> <p>Een favoriet muziekinstrument in de Britse gentlemen\u2019s clubs was de fluit, en dan in het bijzonder de traverso of German flute. De klank herinnert aan de panfluiten van Arcadische herders en saters. De immense populariteit blijkt uit de talrijke fluittranscripties van bekende melodie\u00ebn in muziekcollecties en -magazines. </p> <p>Sketches of Arcadia blaast een aantal van de vroeg 18de eeuwse cantates en liederen, met Arcadia als gezamenlijk thema, nieuw leven in.

L\u2019Inghilterra del tempo cominciava gi\u00e0 a ricoprire il ruolo di grande potenza nella politica europea e globale, grazie alla sua flotta e una crescente influenza coloniale ed industriale.</p> <p>Le possibilit\u00e0 economiche della nuova classe borghese crearono un interessante mercato di svaghi per occupare  il tempo libero dei nuovi ricchi: una densa stagione teatrale, romanzi, poesie e in particolar modo musica d\u2019intrattenimento. Molti musicisti italiani del tempo, come i compositori Giovanni Bononcini, Nicola Porpora ed Attilio Ariosti, cercarono fama e fortuna nell\u2019esuberante metropoli nord europea, un destino ancora condiviso da molti expats del Bel Paese.</p> <p>Non solo compositori, ma anche virtuosi del canto come Margherita de L\u2019\u00c9pine, immortalata nel quadro di Marco Ricci Rehearsal of an opera nell\u2019immagine di copertina del progetto, erano al centro della stagione londinese di eventi mondani e pettegolezzi. Illustri musici, strumentisti e cantanti virtuosi stranieri dominavano la scena londinese, portando con s\u00e9 parte della loro cultura ed arte, spesso in contrasto con l\u2019ideologia ed estetica britannica. Molti documenti d\u2019archivio mostrano come l\u2019eccessivo manierismo italiano era soggetto a dure critiche, considerato troppo stravagante ed eccessivo.</p> <p>Questo scontro culturale era fortunatamente mitigato dal comune patrimonio della mitologia e letteratura classica del mondo greco e latino, in particolar modo il pantheon arcadico di pastori, ninfe, satiri e divinit\u00e0 pagane. Questa mania pastorale, originatasi gi\u00e0 nel Cinquecento, ha affascinato tutta Europa fino al tardo Ottocento, incluse le isole britanniche. Le vicende amorose di un paese idilliaco, dove la natura e la vita semplice regnano indiscusse, era alla base di un modo fantastico condiviso da tutti, trovando intersezioni nel folklore scozzese ed insulare, preannunciando la cultura romantica dei decenni avvenire.</p> <p>Una specie di nefasta profezia che anticiper\u00e0 il desiderio dell\u2019uomo comune di tornare alle origini, annichilito dal progresso scientifico e tecnologico dell\u2019Illuminismo. Strumento principe, praticato nei vari gentlemen\u2019s clubs britannici, \u00e8 il flauto, in particolar modo quello traversiere. Questo strumento a fiato fa riecheggiare il suono mistico del flauto di pan, praticato dai pastori e satiri dell\u2019Arcadia.
