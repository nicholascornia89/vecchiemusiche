In the previous years, Leander could be heard as soloist in Mozart’s Requiem, as well as in several of his masses, the Vespro della Beata Vergine by Monteverdi, Telemann’s Lukas-Passion 1744, Bach’s entire Weihnachtsoratorium as well as his Johannes- and Matthaüs-Passion.
His passion for storytelling comes to full bloom in staged roles, as well as in the narrative oratorio repertoire.

Over the last few years, Leander has joined amongst others Ensemble Ex Tempore (Florian Heyerick), Les Goût Authenthiques (Jan Devlieger), the Vlaams Radiokoor (Bart Van Reyn) and Pandora².
