It didn’t take long for Mieke Dhondt to fall into the musical rabbit hole located in her own hometown Puivelde. At the age of eleven she started singing as a member of Gynaika, a prestigious all-girls choir, and from then on music has been a constant life companion. Mieke took voice classes with Godfried Van de Vyvere at the SAMWD Sint-Niklaas, as well as classes in piano, organ and contemporary ensemble. Currently she is attending the Royal Conservatory Ghent to study classical singing under the watchful eye of bas-bariton Marcos Pujol. In 2019-2020 Mieke and her lied partner Matthias De Smet were coached by Christianne Stotijn as part of the Udo Reinemann Masterclass series, along with masterclasses by Christine Schäfer, Malcolm Martineau, Joseph Breinl and Thomas Oliemans. Starting from 2019, Mieke has been part of the MM Academy, the young singer academy of La Monnaie/De Munt.

As a member of the Modern Barock Ensemble she got to perform the roles of Belinda in ‘Dido and Aeneas’ by Purcell and Galatea in ‘Acis and Galatea’ by Händel. Further operatic roles include Platée in ‘Platée’ by Rameau (Koen Laukens, Jan De Saegher/Dieter Van Handenhoven), Hébé in ‘Les Indes Galantes’ by Rameau (Luigi De Angelis, Korneel Bernolet), Parasha in ‘Mavra’ by Stravinsky (Korneel Hamers/Bruno Ferrandis) and Romilda (Benoît De Leersnyder/Florian Heyerick). Apart from opera, Mieke also sings in the professional ensemble Currende, led by Erik Van Nevel. 

Previous to her vocal studies, Mieke became a Master in Arts: Linguistics and Literature, Latin and Ancient Greek. If not singing, you can find her working as a member of the educational department to the Art & History museum Brussels and Opera Ballet Vlaanderen, and as freelance operator to surtitle opera, theatre and lectures for De Munt/La Monnaie, NTGent and Festival Van Vlaanderen.
