Laura Gekiere, Â°1993, grew up in Gent and studied Art History before discovering a love for classical singing. She was admitted to the Royal Conservatory of Antwerp, but decided to leave after two years to find her own way outside the traditional canon. She has a great love for a wide range of music and singing styles, and is ever curious to find out what to do with the voice as an instrument. In 2019 she started improvising with classical pianist Maya Dhondt, which lead to their musical project/band Hallo met Karel, playing mainly creative covers from Bach to Britney.
